# fuckwm
pronounced (fuckum)  
i got frustrated that my wm wasn't working properly so i rewrote it in zig (bar not included)

## Building
dependencies: zig 0.13.x, Xorg and libc

compile with:
```sh
$ make
```

## Installing
**make sure to edit src/config.zig before building**
```sh
$ make install
```

## Images
because of course i need to show it off
